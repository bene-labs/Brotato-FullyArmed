This mod adds a new character with 30 arms but no way to increase most damage modifiers.

The Fully Armed Character is meant as a counterpart to my favourite character "One Armed". Turns out one good weapon can sometimes be better than 30 horrible ones...
But don't worry, while most damage remains unchangeable with this character, you still can increase melee and ranged damage, albeit at a lower rate. And with 30 weapons slots and a price decrease of 75% you can really go bonkers with the weapon synergies.

This character is meant to be more on the challenging side but with enough melee and ranged damage and some good weapons you should still be able to build up some power.
